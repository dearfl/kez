# Kez

Kez is a rust crate for valve's dota2 web api.

## Motivation

As of 2025/01/09, there are two rust crate for the same functionality, namely `dota2_api` and `dota2_webapi_bindings`, however they are both outdated. In my attempt to write a dota2 match finder in rust, I have to manually write these equivelent code, so I decided to extract those code into a separate crate.

## Naming

Kez is the newest hero added to dota2 as of the time this crate is created(2025/01/09).
